# Coding-Quiz

## Description

This application is a multiple choice coding quiz. Incorrect answers when selected will highlight red and deduct 3 seconds from the countdown. Correct answers will proceed to the next question and when all questions have been correctly answered OR the time runs out - the quiz will end. The score is based on the time remaining so the faster and more accurately that you can complete the quiz, the higher your score will be.
